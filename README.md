# Catastrophe Risk Pricing Blueprint

This project illustrates how to combine hazard raster data, exposure clustering, and stochastic event simulations to estimate catastrophe risk premiums in the insurance industry.

**Key features:**
- Uses CHIRPS precipitation rasters as hazard proxy
- Simulates event-year wildfire losses
- Applies financial terms (deductible, limit)
- Clusters exposure for segmentation
- Compares CAT Load (AAL) with GLM-style expected premium

Created in R using `terra`, `sf`, `ggplot2`, and `dplyr`.
